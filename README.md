# gender_age_detection
For face detection, we have a .pb file- this is a protobuf file (protocol buffer); it holds the graph definition and the trained weights of the model. We can use this to run the trained model. And while a .pb file holds the protobuf in binary format, one with the .pbtxt extension holds it in text format. These are TensorFlow files. For age and gender, the .prototxt files describe the network configuration.
Here, the argparse library is used to create an argument parser so we can get the image argument from the command prompt. We make it parse the argument holding the path to the image to classify gender and age for.
